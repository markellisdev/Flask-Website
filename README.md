# My foray into building an old proof of concept version of my website -- now using Flask, deploying with Lambda using zappa

A couple of years ago, I had created a simple site using [Freelancer](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/freelancer/), a one page freelancer portfolio theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). I haven't been writing in Python since 2017, so I thought I'd pick back up by creating a Flask version of this old site.
